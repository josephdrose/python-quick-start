This repository is a set of configuration files necessary to rapidly start development
on a python / django / django rest framework project with minimal setup required.

Prerequisites:

    Docker desktop

Getting started:

In a command line, run 'docker compose up web'.
Or, click 'play' in pycharm to start the application.

To open a terminal in a running container:

Run 'docker exec -it [container id] bash'
